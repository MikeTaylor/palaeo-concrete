# Proofreading notes for v3 of _The Concrete Diplodocus of Vernal_

<!-- md2toc -l 2 proofreading-notes-v3.md -->

* In the footer to page 65, the suggested citation for this article says "The condrete[sic] _Diplodocus_ of Vernal". This should obviously by "concrete". (This error was also in the previous proof; my apologies for not having caught it then!)
* On page 74, this passage is _still_ wrongly punctuated: "This optimism was to prove misplaced: however, nearly two years later ...". Please please please put it back how it was in the original submission! "This optimism was to prove misplaced, however: nearly two years later ...". For avoidance of doubt, it goes: misplaced, comma, however, colon.
* In the references, nearly all of the URLs still do not link correctly. Perhaps it would be better to simply remove their linking property completely, and make them unclickable simple text?
* In the McIntosh 1981 reference, the phrase "Reptilia, Archosauria" is italicized. I don't think this is correct by your style guide (and is not how it appears in the original publication).
* In the Nieuwland 2019 reference where you meant to insert "318 p", the current proof says "218 p".
