Our manuscript says:

	Some differences exist between the molds and the real skeleton (see Taylor et al. in prep., a for details) but the molds corresponded closely to the original skeleton.

Brinkman suggests "If you're not going to explain this further, it would probably be clearer to leave it out entirely." We have elected to retain this sentence, as the in-prep paper that it refers to is essentially complete, awaiting only last-minute changes before being submitted, and highly relevant to the backstory of the present paper.

Our manuscript says:

	The Buehner Company benefitted from its involvement with the casting, as they discovered in the course of the process that fiberglass made a better and cheaper adhesive than they had previously been using to repair Italian marble

Brinkmam asks how fiberglass is used as an adhesive. I am not a materials scientist and cannot explain this at a better level than I could get from Wikipedia. We know that the Buehner Company discovered this, as it was related by Untermann (1959) but he did not give physical details.
