# Proofreading notes for v2 of _The Concrete Diplodocus of Vernal_

<!-- md2toc -l 2 proofreading-notes-v2.md -->

## Page 65

* In the title, "Diplodocus" is now correctly set in italics; but unlike the rest of the title, it is not bold. Is this a house-style thing, or should it be set in bold italics?

## Page 66

* In the running header (here and on all subsequent pages): because the whole running header (like the cover caption on the inside cover) is all italics, the name "Diplodocus" is not highlighted in typography. Should it be bold italic, as in the cover caption?

## Page 74

* "This optimism was to prove misplaced; however, nearly two years later". I'm afraid this punctuation has got rather mixed up. It should read "This optimism was to prove misplaced, however: nearly two years later".

## Page 76

* "Wann Langston (written communication, 1989; unafilliated)": Langston was probably not unaffiliated, as presently stated -- we simply don't know his affiliation at that time. (Also, unaffiliated is misspelled "unafilliated".)
* "... a verbal communication from John S. McIntosh (unaffiliated)". McIntosh was probably not unaffiliated, as presently stated -- we simply don't know his affiliation at that time. (In both these cases, we are recounting a personal communication that was told to someone else decades ago. Afilliation information was not recorded at the time, and is not really relevant now.)

## Page 82

* "the scaffolding on which was the cast mounted". Please replace with "the scaffolding on which the cast was mounted".

## Page 87

* "the photograph of the double-_Diplodocus_ mount for figure 10": please remove the hyphen for consistency with other mentions of the double _Diplodocus_.
* "Janson Huntzinger": should be "Jason".

## Page 89

* Gilmore 1936: italicize _Apatosaurus_.
* Holland 1915: italicize _Apatosaurus_.

## Page 90

* Norell et al. 1991: italicize _Barosaurus_.

## Page 91

* Taylor et al. in preparation b: italicize _Barosaurus lentus_.

## General

* Almost all links in the references, though they look right in the PDF, do not work correctly when clicked. Most importantly, this applies to the links we added to the two Taylor and others (in preparation) references on page 91.

* Although the newspaper names _Vernal Express_ and _Rocky Mount Evening Telegram_ are now italicized in the references, many other venues (newspapers and journals) are not: for example, in the Contorno (2017) reference on page 90, _Tampa Bay Times_ is not italicized. I don't know if some oddity in the style guide is at work here.

* Book titles are not italicized: for example, in the Dingus (1996) reference on page 90, _Next of Kinâ€”great fossils at the American Museum of Natural History_ is not italicized. Again, I don't know whether this is house style.
