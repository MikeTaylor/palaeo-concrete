Additional illustrations obtained after publication of the paper.

Ken Carpenter found these images at the History Center between 13 and 16 March 2023 while looking through ring binders of uncatalogued photos. He is confident that there are no others waiting to be discovered as he has now examined every uncatalogued photograph in Vernal.

	These were all taken for the Vernal Express (though not necessarily used), and Ken thinks probably taken by Leo Thorne. The last of these shows the pouring of the concrete into a scapulocoracoid mold to make a cast in 1957, in the old Field House building (recognised by Steve Sroka). We can't ID the two men. The one on the left could be the same man as on the left of our Figure 2, but we don't know who that is.

	These were all taken from Life Magazine. We should see whether they were used in an article therein.
