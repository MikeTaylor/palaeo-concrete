	Shows the pouring of the concrete into a scapulocoracoid mold to make a cast in 1957, in the old Field House building (recognised by Steve Sroka). We can't ID the two men. The one on the left could be the same man as on the left of our Figure 2, but we don't know who that is. It was among photos on a contact sheet in a ring binder marked Vernal Express.
