pouring-concrete.png -- Ken Carpenter found this image at the History Center in the morning of 13 March 2023 while looking through ring binders of uncatalogued photos. It was among photos on a contact sheet in a ring binder marked Vernal Express. It seems to show pouring of the concrete into a scapulocoracoid mold to make a cast in 1957 1957. These could be employees of the Otto Buehner Concrete Products Company, hence the unfamiliarity of the faces and the absence of Untermanns. (The ap on the left could be the same man as on the left of our Figure 2.)
