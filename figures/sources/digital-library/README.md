## 3. Assembling the mount

I have made some attempt to get these into order. Note that, contra Untermann 1959, the head is not the last element to go onto the skeleton: the forelimbs are.

## 4a. Completed mount (by date from catalogue)

Some of these dates are wrong: notably, the first two have dates that are from before the mount was erected.
