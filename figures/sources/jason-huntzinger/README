Hi Mike, You are welcome to use this photo, the others were kind of redundant, so I just kept this one. You can just credit my name, Jason Huntzinger. As well as being the Weekend Supervisor at the Prehistoric Museum, I am an adjunct art professor teaching the photography classes here at USU Eastern.
