Mike,

I will look for old color photos and let you know what I find. Also up to you if want other authors on paper besides Ken (like the folks we first communicated with John Foster, etc.) I also have a video of us moving the concrete version down from its hiding palace at the old building. I have attached two photos of the concrete dino parts wrapped ready to begin the move to Price - not sure if this could be the Nieuwland color.
