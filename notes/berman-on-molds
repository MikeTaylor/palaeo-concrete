From McIntosh, after DNM was done with molds they were made available to any instition that wanted to cast its own diplodocus. went to somewhere on the east coast. They went to a farmer for his own public museum. he got in a fight with administration and put all the molds in his barn. They sat there for some time, and the rubber straps that held the molds together perished, leaving a horrendous mess. It would take a crew of half a dozen people six months or more to reassociate the pieces. Which i don't think was ever done. So the molds made one trip from DNM and essentially died.
