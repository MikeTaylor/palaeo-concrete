SOMETHING 'BIG' FOR A FACT
Anonymous

We are referring to the mission to Utah now being performed by Harold Minges, local businessman, Rocky Mount's "Young Man of the Year" and an active office of the Children's Museum. For Mr. Minges has assumed the responsibility of bringing back to Rocky Mount the giant molds of a diplodocus (dinosaur), which will be erected near the Museum in Sunset Park and which should provide a prime attraction when it is completed.
