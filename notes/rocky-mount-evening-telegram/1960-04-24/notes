The director of the Utah museum described in the "Curator" how his staff had utilized the "forgotten" set to construct a replica of weather-proof materials. The article ended: "Would anyone like to cast the twelfth?" (in the world.)
ROCKY MOUNT DOES
The unusual ending caught Mrs. Bell's attention, and she immediately contacted the Museum's board president.

First, it was decided to write to the Utah museum, but to waste no time and run the risk of someone else to lay claim on the set, Mrs. Bell telephoned Utah.

[Museum board president Harold Minges] and Mrs. Bell began making plans to get the molds to Rocky Mount, including a trip to Utah in early June and a quick dispatch back home so that construction can start during the summer.

The diplodocus replica has drawn considerable attention around the world, but many groups have not been interested in building one, mainly because of the problem of transporting molds.

After Rocky Mount builds the twelfth dinosaur, the local museum plans to pass the molds on to the next group that makes satisfactory arrangements to acquire them. And it is possible that the thirteenth replica will follow on the heels of the local project. Already two inquiries have come to the Children's Museum, asking "Who has them next?"
