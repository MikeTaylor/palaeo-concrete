Two files were sent by Steve on 28 July 2022 in an email titled "Additional UFH Dippy information". They break down as follows:

* `2022_07_28_11_46_26.pdf`
  * page 1 (2 April 1989)
    * Sue Ann Bilbey's covering letter to James H. Madsen enclosing Las Vegas correspondence
      * The Royal Museum of Scotland was interested in obtaining a complete skeleton
  * pages 2-4 (8 March 1988)
    * Coperative agreement between Las Vegas Museum of Natural History and the Field House
      * Las Vegas was to disassemble and transport the concrete Diplodocus; make molds; cast two fibreglass replicas from them, retain one and display it with acknowledgement; store the molds which would belong to the Field House; return the concrete original and the second fibreglass replica to Vernal; and mount the new Vernal cast.
      * All at Las Vegas's own cost and under its own insurance.
      * This was to be completed by 30 June 1988 (which seems ludicrously optimistic).
      * Additional casts would be made only with written permission from both the Field House and the Carnegie.
  * page 5 (28 January 1988)
    * Letter from William C. "Lucky" Murdock (Las Vegas) to Alden H. Hamblin (Field House)
      * Initial proposal of the mould-and-cast arrangement, intended to be done between February and June.
      * In this version, Las Vegas would have retained the concrete original, and molds with permission to make more casts.
  * page 6 (blank)
  * page 7 (12 June 1989)
    * Letter from James H. Madsen (Dinolab) to Alden H. Hamblin (Field House)
      * Work is progressing. Lots of work was needed to clean and stabilise the concrete casts: one more winter might have significantly compounded the problems, so the work began just in time.
  * page 8 (blank)
  * pages 9-10 (23 February 1988)
    * Letter from James E. King (Carnegie Museum) to Alden H. Hamblin (Field House)
      * Request that only two casts (Las Vegas and Field House) be made from the new molds, and that the signage on the new mounts acknowledge the Carnegie Museum.

* `2022_07_28_11_50_08.pdf`
  * page 1 (16 May 1989)
    * Letter from James H. Madsen (Dinolab) to Sue Ann Bilbey (Field House)
      * Intends to make "a limited number of replicas, probably under fifteen", and to provide "replacement parts requested by some museums in the past" -- presumably some of the original ten.
      * He is keen to proceed but wary of the project size and of being mired in details and approvals.
  * page 2 (blank)
  * page 3 (29 August 1990)
    * Memo from Alden H. Hamblin to Jerry Miller (director of Utah Parks and Recreation)
      * Explains royalty part of the Dinolab agreement (and mentions it funding "our brachiosaur project"), and asks Miller to formally state the intended use of incoming funds.
  * Page 4 (29 January 1993)
    * Memo from James H. Madsen to Mary Dawson (Carnegie) and Hamblin (Field House)
      * Accounting for royalties on four Diplodocus replicas (all in Japan)
  * page 5 (blank)
  * pages 6-7 (undated)
    * Anonymous pop-sci article: "Dippy" the Traffic Stopper
      * Check consistency: "This spectacular outdoor exhibit was dedicated on June 8, 1957, during the Utah State Lions Club convention at Vernal." (This dates the article between 1957 and 1989.)
      * "The cement skeleton weighs 8 tons, is 76 feet long, and the head rises 21 feet above the ground."
      * "It is made up of approximately 600 separate pieces [...] The third winter and spring were spent assembling the pieces to make up the individual "bones." Some vertebrae, for instance, were made up of 8 or more casts to complete them. These pieces were glued together with fiberglass and reinforced with iron rod."
      * "The casts of the more complicated bones, such as large vertebrae, were made here at the museum" (did we know that?).
      * THere is a bit more on the mechanics of building the cast.
      * An incorrect order is given for the assemble (forelimbs too early).
  * pages 8-19 (January 1990)
    * Anonymous draft of a paper (probably by Madsen): Diplodocus carnegiei: Production and Design of Replica Skeletons
      * "We have also used a variety of plastics in different combinations for casting individual bones" of the Dinolab casts. Details are given.
      * "[...] an Italian artisan, who painstakingly prepared approximately six hundred, individual, very intricate, plaster molds".
      * "It is evident now that the decision at that time to dismantle and repair the skeleton was a wise one, since close examination during preparation and stabilization has relealed incipient fracturing and surface deterioration due to weathering of numerous elements [...] Such damage would have been progressively more difficult, if not impossible, to repair after a few more years of precipitation and the temperature extremes typical of the harsh winters and hot summers of the Uintah Basin."
      * "The manus and pes were earmarked for replacement with elements (or casts) porovided by (?), when it was confirmed that those in the original mount were camarasaurid rather than diplodocid (McIntosh, 1981)."
      * "The fate of the initial set of molds is somewhat in question, but Wann Langston (personal communication, 1989) suggests that they seem to have been lost, strayed, or stolen during transport from ? to ?. Principles contacted in regards to the disposition of the molds could not provide specific information. It is truly a mystery that an estimated 3-6 tons of plaster molds could simply vanish!"
      * "Sculpted elements include the left femur and tibia." **_GOLD DUST!_**
