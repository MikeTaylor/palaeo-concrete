I am a vertebrate palaeontologist specialising in the sauropod dinosaurs. According to the caption of the archive photograph at https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1086142&page=2&q=dippy the Diplodocus molds from which "Dippy" was created were shipped in 1960 from The Utah Field House Museum in Vernal to "the Children's Museum in North Carolina". Could that museum be yours? Are the molds still in your collections?

Thanks,
