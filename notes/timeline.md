# Timeline of the casts leading to the rearing _Barosaurus_

* 1901–1904 (more precision would be good): Carnegie Museum makes molds of _Diplodocus_
* 1904: Five casts are made from these molds
* 1905, May 12: The first cast from these molds is erected as the mount at the BMNH, the second mounted sauropod in the world after the AMNH _Brontosaurus_.
* 1907, April: The actual fossils (and some sculpted elements) are mounted at the Carnegie Museum.
* 1908: further casts are erected in Berlin and Paris
* 1909: the last two casts of the original batch are mounted in Vienna and Bologna.
* 1909-1910: five further casts are made from the molds
* 1910: a cast is mouned in St. Petersburgh (now Leningrad)
* 1912: another cast is mounted in La Plata
* 1913: another cast is mounted in Madrid
* 1914: The Great War breaks out, ending Carnegie's arbitration campaign that was the main reason for donating casts, and reducing the pace of creating new casts.
* 1917 at the latest: the molds went into storage and are not used again, according to Untermann (1959:364).
* 1932: the penultimate cast is mounted in Mexico (with missing/damaged parts produced and added in 1931/2)
* 1934: the final cast is sent to Munich, but never mounted.
* 1948, October 29: The Utah Field House museum opens in Vernal.
* 1952: Vernal native J. LeRoy Kay, Carnegie's curator of vertebrate paleontology, gifts the original molds to the Field House. They arrive on or shortly before 7 August (Untermann 1952). By this time, they were "deteriorating" (Gangewere 1999:17), "almost unusable" (Nieuwland 2019:251) and "in pretty bad shape" (Ken Carpenter, pers. comm. 2022).
* 1957: The Utah Field House's concrete cast is created, and mounted outdoors (Gangewere 1999:17). This is the last time the original molds are used.
* 1950s or 1960s: The Field House posted a notice in the SVP news bulletin offering the plaster molds to who ever wanted them (Ken Carpenter, pers. comm., 2022), but there seem to have been no takers.
* 1960s: the original molds are thrown away by Carnegie Museum (Ilja Nieuwland, pers. comm., 2022). So the invitation that concludes Untermann (1959:369), "Does anyone wish to cast the twelfth?" seems to have gone unanswered.
* 1988, January: plans are made to have a lightweight indoor replica of the Field House concrete cast created by the Las Vegas Museum, but these plans fall through.
* 1989, April: Jim Madsen of Dinolab is contacted to make new plans for creating a replica from the concrete cast
* 1989, June 30 onwards: Dinolab repaired the deteriorated concrete cast, stabilizing, restoring and sealing the bones. Jim Madsen of Dinolab made new molds from the repaired concrete _Diplodocus_, using them to create a new lightweight indoor _Diplodocus_ cast for the Field House, from WEP (water-expanded polyester), and reserving the right to make up to 20 additional casts (Madsen et al. 1989)
* 1991, not later than June 30: Dinolab is contracted to deliver the indoor mount (Madsen et al. 1989) — but I don't know when it actually arrived. It was mounted above the admission counter at the front of the Field House lobby (Ken Carpenter, pers. comm. 2022).
* 1991?: When the concrete specimen was returned to the Field House, it was in bad shape and went into storage rather than being remounted.
* XXX Some time subsequent to 1989: Jack McIntosh arranges a deal between Dinolab and RCI whereby the Dinolab creates casts of the _Diplodocus_ elements needed to make up the missing part of the AMNH _Barosaurus_ mount.
* Subsequent years: further casts are made from the Dinolab molds, including one in the Las Vegas Natural History Museum and one in the Houston Natural History Museum.
* 2004: The Field House moves to a new building, and the WEP cast is remounted in the entry hall.
* 2012: The collections are moved from the old Field House building to the new one, but there is no space for the concrete cast.
* 2013: The concrete cast is sent to Utah State University Eastern Prehistoric Museum on effectively permanent loan, and to be repaired. It was intended to be mounted outside a new museum in Price, but this museum was never built and the cast remains in storage on the Utah State University Eastern campus.
* 2019: Dinolab storage in Ogden, Utah, is scheduled for demolition. The _Diplodocus_ molds that were taken from the concrete cast are moved to RCI, where they are kept in storage: some in good condition, some in rough shape. These are probably the only Carnegie _Diplodocus_ molds in the world.

Photographs of the concrete Diplodocus can be found at the [J. Willard Marriott Digital Library of the University of Utah](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/).
