Ken Carpenter comments on the discovery of CM 84:

Found before July 19, 1899 based on letter of that date from Wortman to Holland ”I do not wish to overwhelm you with good news but we have some mighty fine bones and a whole lot of them. I am almost afraid to say what I think we have but from present indications we will put in the best season I have ever had in the Bone Digging business. We have "a mighty good stagger" at a skeleton of Diplodocus which is a "rare bird indeed" and others almost too numerous to mention.”
